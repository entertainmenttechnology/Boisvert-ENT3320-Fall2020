1,1,Aki,"Now where are you heading to, Zeno?"
2,2,Aki ,This place has been shut down ever since Brooklyn became a server haven. What business does he have in there?
3,3,Rebel 1,"Your mission will be located on the first floor training city to your left, Zeno."
4,3,Zeno,"Alright, thank you."
5,4,Zeno,"Okay, let's get to work."
6,5,Aki,"(There are guards in the front. Should I try asking to go in, or find another way?)"
7,6,Rebel 1,Do you have any business here?
8,6,Aki ,"I saw someone else enter, why can’t I?"
9,6,Rebel 2,You can’t enter with us here. Get lost.
10,6,Aki,"Chill, alright. (No need to be so aggressive...)"
11,6,Aki,(I need to find a way around them.)
12,7,Aki,(This door is locked. Nothing but a good hack can help me bypass it.)
13,8,Aki,"(Lightwork. Now, where could Zeno be?)"
14,9,Aki,(Hold on... are those voices?)
15,9,Rebel 3,Have you seen the training facility on the first floor? We should go.
16,9,Rebel 4,Zeno has a training session there right now. Let’s go later.
17,9,Rebel 3,"Okay, cool."
18,9,Aki,(So that’s where he’s at…)
19,10,Aki,"That was amazing, how were you able to do that?"
20,10,Zeno,What are you doing here? You being here is putting us at risk.
21,10,Aki,...What are you talking about?
22,11,Huicq,"Aki, it’s been so long. How’d you get in here?"
23,11,Aki,"I used the door on the right. It was locked, but y’all security is trash."
24,11,Huicq,Oho!
25,11,Huicq,"Alright Aki, I need you to answer this whole heartedly, no lies, no deceit. "
26,11,Huicq,"If you want to leave, or if we don’t like your answers, we can just go back to being normal. You’ll forget everything."
27,14,Huicq,"Now tell me: which one to you means ""bewildered""?"
28,15,Huicq,Which one shows a narrow mind?
29,16,Huicq,Which one shows discrimination?
30,17,Huicq,"Your heart is pure, Aki. You have strong will and talent."
31,17,Huicq,"Even after we showed you the truths of the world, you haven’t shown any fear at all. "
32,17,Huicq,"Aki, will you be a part of the war? Will you be our comrade?"
33,18,Aki,"Yes, I’m in. I’ll be fighting for the greater cause."
34,18,Zeno,This will be rather interesting.
35,18,Huicq,Let’s get her started. 
36,18,Huicq,Just remember that there is no rush. You are the embodiment of your own choices. 
37,18,Huicq,The choices you make have weight. Never forget that.
38,19,Aki,Maybe. I’ll have to put some thought into this. All of this info is overwhelming.
39,19,Huicq,There's no rush. You are the embodiment of your own choices. The choices you make have a weight to it. Never forget that.
40,19,Huicq,The choices you make have weight. Never forget that.
41,19,Huicq,"Aki and Zeno, you’ll both be heading towards the windy city, also known as Chicago."
42,19,Huicq,Chicago didn’t undergo the Techno Revolution so there still stuck as if it was still 2020. 
43,19,Huicq,"When you get to the city, you’ll be looking for the Faction Leader of the Children of Eris. Her name is Angela Baker. "
44,19,Huicq,You’ll get there using our teleportation device. 
45,19,Huicq,She’ll be giving you the details once you arrive at the base. 
46,19,Huicq,Good luck out there.
47,21,Guard 1,"Hey, dem kids over there is gonna be on their deathbed soon?"
48,21,Guard 2,"Yeah that sounds like a death trap knowing that there are traps within the area
"
49,21,Guard 2,Yo put me on
50,21,Guard 1 ,That man Huicq be acting mad dumb bro.
51,21,Guard 1,Like who sends their mans into a death trap like that.
52,21,Guard 2,"I’ma keep it a buck with you,them kids better scout before their ass gets finished.."
53,22,Zeno,Angela Baker?
54,22,Angela,Archie from Riverdale??
55,22,Aki,"Haha, that reference is spot on."
56,22,Angela,"You're not slick, with your fufu ass beats."
57,22,Zeno,(Smirks)
58,22,Zeno,Huicq sent us here to-
59,22,Angela,"That Chicago is the epicenter for shipment from across the world. That only means one thing, they've got the good shit."
60,22,Angela,"From ArgBots, to Dragon Drones to Bio Weaponry. Yous are going to snag those supplies for us."
61,22,Aki,"...That's not right, we shouldn't be stealing from the government."
62,22,Angela,"I don’t wanna hear none of that hero shit, you don’t know what we’ve dealt with throughout tha years. "
63,22,Angela,THE GOV DON’T FUND US AND THEY NEVER HAVE.
64,22,Angela,WE ARE A COMMUNITY THAT RELIES ON EACH OTHAS BACK. 
65,22,Aki,"BUT YOU DON’T NEED TO FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE, WE’LL BE STEPPING DOWN TO THEIR LEVEL!"
66,22,Zeno,"Everyone, calm down."
67,22,Aki,*INHALING EXHALING SOUNDS*
68,22,Aki,"Listen I’m here to help, I’ll fight but in my own way, "
69,22,Aki,I won’t succumb to those low level tactics. 
70,22,Aki,"You need me, however, I don’t need you. I’m not about to change my ideals over a thieving fox."
71,22,Angela,*SCOFFS* hahahahahahaahaaha
72,22,Angela,"Shit, your mind is living a fairytale but you already know that. "
73,22,Angela,The people of Chicago and I have made it this far because of this ruthless mentality. 
74,22,Angela,We one up this bullshit ass Jagoff each time to the point of them knowing who I am and what I’m capable of. 
75,22,Angela,"Now Aki, look around you, I did this. "
76,22,Angela,"Do what you want, but you’ll never achieve anything great with that mindset."
77,22,Aki,"The people of Chicago don’t want this lifestyle, everything would’ve changed if yo -"
78,22,Angela,A birdie told me that there will be Techno Weaponry inside one of the shipment crates. 
79,22,Angela,Think of what we can do with that shit in our arsenal. This is how we will go about the sitch.
80,23,Aki,I still don't think this is right Zeno.
81,23,Zeno,"She's the leader, my father told us to do what we are told. Although, her actions are suspicious."
82,23,Aki,I know... but this doesn't sit right with me. This isn't what I expected when I came over here.
83,23,Zeno,"Let's just get this mission over with, let's go."
84,24,Zeno,We're in.
85,24,Angela,"Good shit, I guess yous are some useful scrubs. Okay, there shouldd be some bullshit coming up. Handle that."
86,24,Aki,I still don't believe that we should be thieving foxes.
87,24,Angela,Can't you get this through your thick skull.
88,25,Aki,"Zeno, inside of that crate, there should be one of the items we're looking for. Although, someone is guarding it."
89,25,Aki,There's a few in that general direction. I'll tell you where exactly.
90,26,Zeno,I'm going in.
91,27,Zeno,"Aki, come down here."
92,28,Aki,I'll tell Angela.
93,28,Zeno,Weren't you against us stealing from the government.
94,28,Aki,"I still am, however, I won't tolerate the use of bio weaponry against people, whether they're working for the Gov or not."
95,28,Aki,"Angela, we've located the shipment."
96,28,Aki,"Ahh, you've turned over a new leaf. This is da mindset you need to survive in this bullshit ass world."
97,28,Angela,"Bring it back to the base. Oooo, shit, I'm getting excited now."
98,29,Angela,"Oooo, yess, I've been waiting ma long for this."
99,30,Angela,You've got to be f...
100,31,Angela,"Alright, after chilling for a while. I'm good now, so I have ya next mission. Ya have to head to priviledged Sillicon Valley."
101,32,Aki,"Zeno, I can't accept these terms. This is blasphemy, I'm fighting for freedom but I won't stoop down to Government level."
102,32,Aki,I was raised better than that.
103,32,Zeno,We can't just jeopardize the mission off of your morals. 
104,32,Aki,"My morals? That woman's morals are depriving, I can't continue working with her when she's just as appalling as the Gov."
105,33,Zeno,Do what you want. I won't be put in between this cat fight.
106,34,Aki,"Angela, the weapons are damaged. What should we do?"
107,34,Angela,"Shit, alright. Dip from there, we'll discuss our plan of action at the base."
108,35,Angela,"Alright, it's no surprise that I'm disappointed but... I'm disappointed."
109,35,Zeno,(Because of what Aki did to those weapons...)
110,35,Aki,I preferred this option so I don't mind it at all.
111,35,Angela,"Wait, I've got a serious question. Who asked you?"
112,35,Aki,(She makes my blood boil.)
113,35,Aki,Stealing and killing makes us look  as if we are the monsters. That is if we had those weapons-
114,35,Angela,This girl just can't keep her mouth shut. This conversation is over because we'll be getting nowhere.
115,36,Angela,We'll manage with what we've got. I have ya next mission. Ya have to head to the priveledged land of Sillicon Valley.
116,36,Angela,"Yous will meet our inventor and leader of the Y8tes, Dr. Weiner. He'll explain your next mission."
117,37,Rebel 1,These ops are sus not gonna lie
118,37,Rebel 2,Sure thing. All I know is that we gotta go by that area overthere.
119,37,Rebel 1,Well first thing is that we gon need to establish what items we need. Best to keep checkin the list she gave us
120,37,Rebel 2,Does it Matter?
121,37,Rebel 1,It depends on how long we decide to stay doing the mission. Who knows the longer we are the benefits of helping out the base.
122,38,Secret Rebel,Hey Aki and Zeno what's new?!
123,38,Secret Rebel,"Oh that's cool and all. However, You guys do know that I am an ex-Goverment worker right?"
124,38,Secret Rebel,"Well, you see the leader is very picky on who she wants on her team for the tech branch. However, from what I heard she’s a very strict and antsy person. Some even said that if things don’t go her way then she takes it out on others."
125,39,Aki,"I've never been to Cali before, look at how different the people are!"
126,39,Zeno,"Compared to Brooklyn, there's people everywhere with those enhancements."
127,39,Aki,Angela called the people here Shellheads
128,39,Zeno,What's that?
129,39,Aki,People with cybernetic implants. It's supposed to be offensive since they're walking technology parts.
130,39,Zeno,Shouldn't have asked...
131,39,Aki,"Anyways, I wonder who this Dr. Weiner is."
132,39,Zeno,He's the reaason that we are able to fight in this battle.
133,39,Aki,He invented a device that prevents any form of brainwashing that the government provides.
134,39,Zeno,He sounds incredible. How was he able to do it?
135,39,Aki,"We'll find out soon, we should be seeing him soon."
136,40,Dr. Weiner,"Welcome kiddos, I'm ready to provide the operation you two will be finalizing today."
137,40,Dr. Weiner,Upstairs is the medical facilty that is overrun by the government.
138,40,Zeno,"They've acquired a substantial amount of Personalized Biosphere Shields, however, it's not being shared with the people properly."
139,40,Dr. Weiner,"Now, what do the two of you think when I say something like that? Hm."
140,40,Zeno,There is something embedded inside of the Personalized Biosphere Shields?
141,40,Dr. Weiner,"Mmm, and you, what do you believe dear?"
142,40,Aki,"Huicq mentioned it, I presume it's about the Shields having a brainwashing effect and we'll need a Plasmic Integrated thingy..."
143,40,Dr. Weiner,Plasmic Integrated Viral Ward. Both are fantastic answers. Come with me you two.
144,41,Dr. Weiner,"The PBS are in the Medical Facilty upstairs. You guys entered through the hidden teleporter in the parking lot, correct?"
145,41,Aki,Yes
146,41,Zeno,Yes
147,41,Dr. Weiner,"Fantastic, so that area is how you'll be sneaking around to enter the base. Once you're in the base, you'll follow this path."
148,41,Dr. Weiner,"That's where the PBS are located. Once you've secured the supplieds, bring them back to me."
149,41,Dr. Weiner,"I have faith in the two of you, good luck."
150,42,World,Removes the headset
151,42,Patient,SCREAMS
152,42,Aki,"Shh, it's okay, it's okay."
153,42,Zeno,Be quiet
154,42,Aki,You're in a better place.
155,42,Patient,"I want to go back to that world, this world sucks."
156,42,Patient,My parents were killed when a group of Cybernetic Enhanced People stormed our house with no intentions but to kill...
157,42,Patient,I was sent to an orphanage after the incident.
158,42,Patient,Us kids from the Orphanage were taken to this hospital for multiple studies. We were guinea pigs and still are.
159,42,Patient,Crying
160,42,Patient,"I...miss...them so much, I get to see them in the other world I was in. This world is nothing but despair. My heart aches every time I think about them."
161,42,Patient,"why, Why, WHy, WHY WAS I LEFT BEHIND!"
162,42,Patient,"I miss mom's lullabies, I miss them so much."
163,42,Aki,Your dad and mom wouldn't want to see you like this.
164,42,Zeno,They'll want to see you strive with your head up.
165,42,Aki,"They would want you to survive. Yeah, the world sucks right now but there's people out trying to make a change. We are one of those people."
166,42,Patient,What do you mean by change?
167,42,Zeno,We're going to overthrow the government and make our country a better place to live. You'll be out there with no restrictions.
168,42,Aki,You can live life with a smile on your face. You'll be able to be whatever you want to be.
169,42,Aki,"Stay positive, that's what your parents would want you to do."
170,42,Patient,"Please, for us."
171,42,Zeno,"Trust us, for everyone."
172,42,Aki,"We'll pick you up on our way back, don't worry."
173,42,Patient,Thank you.
174,43,Aki,He's probably led a difficult life. You're in a better place now.
175,43,Zeno,"No one should go through this pain, this is blasphemy. The person behind all of this has no heart."
176,43,Aki,"This is why we are fighting, for the sake of not only ourselves but others."
177,43,Zeno,Let's leep looking for the PBS.
178,44,Dr. Weiner,"You're within reach to the PBS, there's securiy all around the area, work your craft."
179,45,Zeno,The shields are here.
180,45,Dr. Weiner,Fetch them and bring them back to the base.
181,46,Dr. Weiner,Welcome back. Place the shields on the table over there.
182,46,World,Place shield down
183,47,World,Booting Up Sound
184,47,Aki,"You're really good, how do you know so much about the PBS?"
185,47,Dr. Weiner,Being the originator of this monstrosity...
186,48,Aki,I appreciate everything you've done for this group and the people around you.
187,48,Zeno,We're grateful for what you've done. You've saved the world and you're helping the world right now.
188,48,Dr. Weiner,"I appreciate your opinnions kids but nothing can change my mind. Once we're saved, I'll celebrate."
189,48,Dr. Weiner,"Now, your next mission will be rather difficult."
190,48,Dr. Weiner,It's not my type of style but it's what we'll have to do for the sake of this country.
191,48,Dr. Weiner,"Head to Manhattan, you'll meet Hordin Morales, the leader of Bello-Techno. Take care and remain safe."
192,48,Aki,Yes
193,48,Zeno,Yes
194,49,Dr. Weiner,(They're too young to be asssigned such a task. I wish the best of luck to everyone. Our fight isn't over.)
195,50,Rebel 1,Man this area is truly filled with government agents everywhere.
196,50,Rebel 2, I’m guessing this is now our society over here. Best to keep our heads down.
197,50,Rebel 1 ,Yeah. If we are spotted by the government we are fucked. 
198,50,Rebel 2,"Keep a low profile and make sure you are not spotted. If so, then we are done for."
199,51,Senior Rebel,Yo Kids!
200,52,Aki ,Not now we are on the move
201,53,Aki ,Hey whats up
202,53,Senior Rebel,"Good to know that the things in Chicago went well. Look, that leader I told you guys about."
203,53,Senior Rebel,Well I just got word from my old mates that the acts we did in chicago truly ruffled up her feathers. 
204,53,Senior Rebel,"But hearing that we made an impact on her might bite us back on our asses. So keep an eye out."
205,54,Aki,"There's so many of us for this raid, do you think we need this many people?"
206,54,Zeno,"We need this, we can't mess this up. THe fate of our country is in stake."
207,54,Aki,"Yeah... hopefully, everything goes well!"
208,55,Hordin,Make haste and prepare the Stealth wear.
209,55,World,Turns on Stealth Wear
210,55,Huicq,"Zeno and a few of others, you're with me, we'll clear the path for Bello-Techno."
211,55,Zeno,Yes sir.
212,55,Hordin,"Novice, you're with us, we'll help the bypass through any obstacles that come their way."
213,56,Hordin,"We're approaching our destination, it's heavily guarded, take em out so we can go inside."
214,56,Huicq,"Understood, let's do what we do best."
215,57,Huicq,Guard the door comrades.
216,57,Huicq,"Zeno, you've got to keep watch as well."
217,58,Aki,"Top secret, what is this??"
218,58,Hordin,"Looks important, gather whatever we can and let''s get out of here."
219,58,Hordin,I'll work on adding security measures for us just in case we're ambushed.
220,58,Aki,Will do.
221,59,Aki,"Come on Aki you can do this, you're good at what you know, and hacking is all you know."
222,59,World,Red flashing lights with siren
223,59,Computer,Multiple people detected in Sector 1 Hallway 25
224,60,Huicq,"Finish the mission at all costs, no matter what happens to any of us, our humanity is at stake here."
225,61,World,Typing on a keyboard
226,61,Aki,"I'll save you Huicq, don't worry."
227,62,Computer,Failed. Please Try Again...
228,62,Aki,Why isn't working?
229,62,World,Button Press
230,62,Computer,Failed. Please Try Again...
231,62,Computer,Failed. Please Try Again...
232,62,Computer,Failed. Please Try Again...
233,62,Aki,Why...Why...Why... Why is this happening?!?
234,63,Huicq,"Finish the mission at all costs, no matter what happens to any of us, our humanity is at stake here."
235,63,Aki,"I'm almost done Huicq, hang in there."
236,64,Patricia,"Clean this up, find out who he is. We treat what happened here as nothing happened."
237,64,Patricia,"We need to prepare for tracking the rest of these bugs, they're less spyware and more of a worm."
238,64,Patricia,These maggotts need me to be pest control.
239,65,Zeno,Where's my father?
240,65,Zeno,WHERE IS HE?!?
241,65,Hordin,He was murdered... We have to get out of here before anything goes wrong.
242,65,Zeno,Dad...
243,66,Rebel 1,Don’t know bout you but something off here.
244,66,Rebel 2,How so? We got everything. That raid was mad easy.
245,66,Rebel 1,I know but that's the thing. That raid “was”mad easy.  Keep your guard up. Shit is coming.
246,67,Senior Rebel,Hey Zeno. Aki!
247,67,Aki ,Not now old timer.
248,67,Aki  ,"Hey,old timer whats up"
249,67,Senior Rebel,-Look. Remember what I told you that that leader I told you I had. .
250,67,Senior Rebel,"Well let’s just say. From what I heard, things are about to go bat shit crazy. Keep your guard up"
251,67,Aki,
252,67,Senior Rebel,I don’t know. But something is happening. Just being in here and the tension in the air feels just like her.
253,68,Aki,"(The Pentagon is massive, is there a need for this many rooms.)"
254,68,Zeno,(The amount of guards in here seems endless. I turn the corner and there's another guard there.)
255,69,Aki,"Zeno, take out the guards guarding that room. Akasha is in there."
256,69,Zeno,Already thinking ahead of you.
257,70,Aki,This is it. Our year long goal is behind this door.
258,70,Zeno,"Father will be proud of what we accomplish today, no more standinng around."
259,70,Zeno,Go in there and gather the information Aki.
260,70,Aki,"Someone's taking the leadership role to the heart, will do."
261,71,Aki,I'm in.
262,71,Zeno,"Great, get what you can and let's get out of here."
263,71,Zeno,Aki?? Aki?? Are you there??
264,71,Aki,"I'm in disbelief, the information in the Akasha, it's all of us."
265,71,Zeno,What do you mean?
266,71,Aki,"They have information on everyone in this country, strengths, weaknesses, what they brainwashed them on and more."
267,71,Zeno,"Getting information like that will definitely put Eu-Topos Imperium in a blunder. If not, completely shut them down. "
268,71,Aki,"I can upload everything we have from here, this will take the world by storm."
269,71,Zeno,"Do that, I'll continue to keep watching the area."
270,72,Aki,"Everyone, we've completed the mission. Everyone should be coming back to their senses."
271,73,Patrcia,WHAT DID YOU DO?!?
272,73,Aki,WHAT DID I DO?!? WHAT DID YOU DO TO HUMANITY?!?
273,74,Patrcia,"You stupid neanderthal, tech was the answer. Tech was our hope to finally uniting this forsaken world.0"
274,74,Emotion,What is wrong with you!
275,74,Patrcia,"Me,Me!! I was the prophet to the people. I was their shepherd. You don't know sheep they are sheep, you lead them and feed."
276,74,Patrcia,Never open their curiousity to think more.
277,74,Patrcia,My chauvinistic heart led me to save them. The AI President and Akasha were my brainchild to these fools.
278,74,Aki,"We saved people, your hope was in tech."
279,74,Aki,Mine was in humanity.
280,74,Aki,"Since the beginning of times, we have defied the odds to make it here."
281,74,Patrcia,Then save me.
282,74,Emotion,Looks confused with disgust on her face
283,74,Patrcia,"Tech was saving us, without it we are doomed you addlebrains. Put me out my misery, do it you dam hero."
284,75,Emotion,Screams
285,75,Aki,"You took away my best friend's father, you took away someone who was looked up to by everyone all around."
286,75,Aki,"Someone who deserved better than to be shot by the master and her dogs. You're dead to me, go to hell..."
287,76,Zeno,WHAT DID YOU DO?!?
288,76,Aki,Become a monster...
289,77,Aki,I hope everyone is okay.
290,78,Aki,I'm fighting for freedom but I won't stoop down to the level of the Government.
291,79,Zeno,What are you doing Aki?
292,79,Aki,Being the bigger person
293,79,Zeno,This is my father's killer?
294,79,Zeno,Yes
295,79,Patrcia,"Look at you, a cretin just like your father."
296,79,Aki,"ZENO, STOP!"
297,79,World,Smack
